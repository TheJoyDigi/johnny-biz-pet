      "Hi! I’m Johnny — a lifelong animal lover with over 15 years of hands-on experience caring for dogs of all sizes, ages, and personalities. I’ve worked as a veterinary assistant, cared for whole groups of Bernese Mountain Dogs (up to 20 at once!), and now specialize in creating a calm, boutique-style boarding experience that helps pups feel safe, relaxed, and understood.",
      "For years, I worked in corporate finance, but dog care was always where I felt the most fulfilled. Eventually, I followed that feeling and transitioned into pet care full-time. It’s the best decision I’ve ever made — now your dog gets my full attention, patience, and presence all day long.",
      "🧰 My Background & Approach",
      "✔ Vet-assistant trained — comfortable with medication, special cases, and senior care",
      "✔ Experienced with shy, anxious, or high-energy pups",
      "✔ Skilled at reading dog body language and keeping group play calm and positive",
      "✔ Focused on both physical care and emotional well-being",
      "I take a structured, calming approach with every dog — gentle introductions, predictable routines, and a peaceful environment where each pup gets one-on-one attention.",
      "🏡 What Pet Parents Can Expect",
      "• A cozy, upscale home environment — never chaotic like a kennel",
      "• Thoughtful, supervised group play",
      "• Flexible daily routines tailored to your dog’s needs",
      "• Clean, tidy spaces (I deep-clean after every stay)",
      "• Plenty of affection, enrichment, and relaxation",
      "• Tons of real-time photo/video updates so you’ll always know how your pup is doing",
      "❤️ Why Pet Parents Book With Me",
      "• Trained & Trusted Care — My experience lets me confidently handle everything from routine care to more sensitive cases.",
      "• Calm, Safe Environment — I host only friendly, house-trained pups to ensure a peaceful stay.",
      "• Boutique Experience — Your dog gets enrichment, comfort, and personalized attention — more like a cozy retreat than a boarding facility.",
      "• Home All Day — I’m fully present, offering the kind of consistent supervision and companionship most dogs crave.",
      "• Fun Add-Ons — From sniffaris to aromatherapy, pups enjoy unique touches that make their stay extra special.",
      "• Daily Updates — You’ll never wonder how your pup is doing — I send tons of photos and videos throughout the day.",
      "Your dog becomes part of the family here — safe, relaxed, and loved. I can’t wait to welcome them into my home. 🐾✨"

      "Hi there! I’ve been around dogs my entire life, from playful puppies to sweet seniors, and caring for them is truly one of my greatest joys. As a full-time stay-at-home mom, I naturally became the “go-to” sitter for friends, neighbors, and family — and over the years, it’s grown into something I genuinely love doing.",
