      "Hi! I’m Johnny, and I offer boutique-style staycations where your pup gets to enjoy luxury, calm, and personalized care in a home that feels like their own little retreat.",
      "I’m all about creating a calm, structured environment where dogs actually feel safe and can relax from the moment they walk in. My home is set up with their comfort in mind—peaceful spaces to chill, cozy spots for naps, a fully fenced patio for outdoor time, and I keep everything clean and tidy throughout their stay.",
      "I’ve been working with dogs for over 15 years, including time as a vet assistant, so I’m comfortable with medication, special needs, and senior pups. I recently left my corporate job to do this full time, which means your dog gets my full attention all day long.",
      "Whether your pup is shy, super energetic, or somewhere in between, I meet them where they are. I build my day around what your dog needs—not the other way around. That means gentle introductions, consistent routines, calm group play, and lots of love and fun activities.",
      "My Care Style",
      "• Gentle, low-stress introductions to help dogs settle in",
      "• Clear, consistent routines tailored to your pup’s comfort",
      "• Calm group dynamics with close supervision",
      "• Reading & supporting dog body language to keep interactions positive",
      "• A peaceful environment with plenty of affection, enrichment, and relaxation",
      "What Pet Parents Can Expect",
      "• A warm, upscale home environment — never chaotic like a kennel",
      "• Predictable daily rhythms that help dogs relax",
      "• Thoughtful group play with close oversight",
      "• Clean, tidy spaces (I deep-clean after every stay)",
      "• Optional add-ons for enrichment, outings, or vacation-style fun",
      "• Reliable photo/video updates so you always know how your pup is doing"
