With apps like Rover and Wag making it easy for anyone to sign up as a pet sitter, it's harder than ever to know who is actually qualified. Your dog is family, and their safety should never be a gamble.

If you are looking for a dog sitter in Orange County, don't be afraid to ask the hard questions. Here is the safety checklist we recommend using before booking anyone.

## 1. Are They Insured and Bonded?
Accidents happen. A professional sitter will carry comprehensive pet sitting insurance (like PCI or PSA) that covers veterinary care if your dog gets injured in their care.
*   *Ask to see proof of insurance.*

## 2. What Is The Vetting Process?
Does the sitter have a criminal background check? If they run a multi-sitter agency, do they interview their staff in person?
At Ruh-Roh Retreat, every sitter undergoes a rigorous vetting process that includes background checks, reference calls, and hands-on skill assessments.

## 3. Physical Safety of the Home
If you are choosing in-home boarding, the environment itself must be secure.
*   **Fencing:** Is the yard fully fenced? Are there gaps a small dog could squeeze through?
*   **Hazards:** Are toxic plants or chemicals out of reach?
*   **Separation:** Can they separate dogs if a conflict arises?

## 4. Experience with Emergencies
Ask the sitter: *"What would you do if my dog started choking?"* or *"What is your protocol if you have to evacuate?"*
A qualified sitter will have clear, confident answers. They should know pet CPR and have a relationship with a local 24-hour emergency vet.

## Trust Your Gut
Finally, observe how the sitter interacts with your dog during the Meet & Greet. Do they get down on the dog's level? Do they ask about triggers and fears?
Safety isn't just about fences and locks; it's about a sitter who is attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely cares.
