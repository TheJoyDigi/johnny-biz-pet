Have you ever noticed your dog standing by their food bowl at 5:59 PM exactly, staring at you with expectation? Or how they bring you their leash at the same time every morning?

Dogs are creatures of habit. They rely on routine to feel safe and understand their world. Predictability lowers their cortisol levels and helps them relax. When you go on vacation and leave them in a new environment, that sense of predictability can shatter—unless you choose a boarding option that prioritizes structure.

## The Chaos of the "Free-For-All"

Many boarding facilities operate on their own schedule, not your dog's.
*   "Lights out" might be hours earlier or later than your dog is used to.
*   Feeding happens in a rush.
*   Playtime is often a chaotic free-for-all in a large yard with dozens of other stimulated dogs.

This sudden lack of structure can lead to "boarding stress," causing digestive upset, loss of appetite, and exhaustion.

## The Power of a Customized Routine

At Ruh-Roh Retreat, we believe the best way to keep a dog calm is to mimic their life at home. Before your dog arrives, we ask detailed questions about their day:
*   *What time do they wake up?*
*   *Do they walk before or after breakfast?*
*   *Do they get a midday snack?*
*   *What is their wind-down ritual at night?*

## Why It Matters

**1. Physical Health:**
Regular potting and feeding times prevent accidents and upset stomachs. A dog who eats on schedule digests better.

**2. Mental Security:**
When a dog knows what comes next, they don't have to be anxious. "Okay, we just had our walk, now it's nap time." This rhythm signals safety.

**3. Better Sleep:**
A stimulating day followed by a familiar evening routine ensures your dog actually sleeps through the night, rather than pacing or barking.

## Continuity is Key

We don't just "watch" your dog; we step into your shoes. By maintaining the structure you've worked hard to build, we ensure that when you return, your dog is just as happy, healthy, and well-behaved as when you left.

Routine isn't boring—it's the language of love for your dog.
