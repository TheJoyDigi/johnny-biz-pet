Packing for your own vacation is stressful enough—you shouldn't have to worry about your dog's suitcase, too! To make drop-off day a breeze, we've compiled the ultimate packing checklist for a stay at Ruh-Roh Retreat.

## The Essentials

**1. Food (Pre-Portioned)**
This is the most important item. Sudden changes in diet can cause stomach upset, especially when combined with the excitement of a new environment.
*   *Please pre-portion meals into individual Ziploc bags labeled with AM/PM.* This ensures your dog gets the exact amount they need every time.

**2. Medications & Supplements**
If your dog takes medication, please bring it in the original bottle with clear instructions. We are experienced in administering meds, including insulin injections.

**3. Collar with ID Tag**
Even though we are a secure facility, safety comes first. Ensure your dog has a well-fitting collar with an up-to-date ID tag.

## Comfort Items (Highly Recommended)

**4. A Piece of Home**
We encourage you to bring a t-shirt you've worn recently or a small blanket that smells like home. This "scent anchor" provides immense comfort to your dog when they are settling in for the night.

**5. Their Favorite Toy**
Does your dog have a specific stuffed squeaker they can't sleep without? Bring it along! (Just maybe leave the heavy-duty chew toys at home if they are resource guarders).

## What You can Leave at Home
*   **Bowls:** We have plenty of stainless steel, sanitized bowls.
*   **Huge Beds:** We have orthopedic beds in every room, but you are welcome to bring a small bed if it fits easily in your car.
*   **Crates:** We have standard crates if your dog prefers them, but please let us know if your dog requires a specific heavy-duty crate.

By packing smart, you ensure your dog settles in quickly and starts enjoying their vacation from the moment they arrive!
