When you walk your dog, are you on a mission to get from Point A to Point B? If so, you might be missing out on the most enriching part of the walk for your dog: the sniffing.

At Ruh-Roh Retreat, we practice what we call "Sniffari" walks. These aren't power walks for exercise; they are decompression sessions for the brain.

## The Nose Knows

A dog's sense of smell is their primary way of interacting with the world. Navigating a neighborhood without sniffing is like walking through an art gallery blindfolded.
When a dog sniffs, they are processing complex information: who was here, what did they eat, is there a squirrel nearby? This mental effort is just as tiring—if not more so—than physical exercise.

## What is a Sniffari?

A Sniffari is a dog-led walk.
1.  **Long Leash:** We use a longer leash to give the dog freedom to explore safely.
2.  **Dog's Pace:** If they want to spend 3 minutes sniffing a single blade of grass, we let them.
3.  **Nature Rich:** We prioritize routes with grass, dirt, and trees over concrete sidewalks.

## The Benefits of Decompression

Sniffing lowers a dog's pulse rate and encourages them to relax. It releases dopamine and engages their natural seeking instincts.
After a 30-minute Sniffari, dogs usually return home feeling satisfied and "good tired." They are less likely to be destructive or anxious because their biological needs have been met.

So next time you're out, put away the phone, loosen the leash, and let your dog lead the way. It's their walk, after all.
