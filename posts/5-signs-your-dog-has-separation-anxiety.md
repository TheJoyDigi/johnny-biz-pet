Leaving your dog behind when you travel is never easy, but for dogs with separation anxiety, it can be downright traumatic. Unlike simple sadness, separation anxiety is a genuine panic response that can manifest in destructive or distressing ways.

At Ruh-Roh Retreat, we specialize in caring for sensitive pups. But first, you need to know what to look for. Here are the 5 most common signs that your dog struggles when you're gone.

## 1. Excessive Pacing and Panting
If your dog starts pacing in circles or panting heavily as soon as you grab your keys, they are already building up anxiety. This "pre-departure anxiety" sets the tone for their entire experience alone.

## 2. Destructive Behavior
Chewed doorframes, scratched floors, or destroyed pillows aren't usually signs of a "bad dog." They are signs of a frantic dog trying to escape or soothe themselves through chewing.

## 3. Vocalization (Barking and Howling)
Neighbors complaining about constant barking? Persistent vocalization is a cry for help. It's your dog trying to call you back to the pack.

## 4. Accidents Indoors
A house-trained dog who suddenly urinates or defecates inside when left alone is often experiencing a loss of bowel control due to extreme stress.

## 5. Shadowing
Does your dog follow you from room to room, terrified to let you out of their sight? This "velcro dog" behavior often correlates with high anxiety when separation actually occurs.

## How Boutique Boarding Helps
Traditional kennels can exacerbate these symptoms. Being left alone in a run for hours, even with other dogs nearby, can feel like abandonment.

**We do things differently.**

*   **Constant Companionship:** Our sitters are home. Your dog isn't left alone to spiral.
*   **Home Environment:** The sights, sounds, and smells of a real home (TV, cooking, sofas) provide a sense of normalcy that concrete kennels cannot.
*   **Distraction & Engagement:** We use interactive play, puzzles, and "sniffari" walks to keep your dog's brain engaged and away from anxious thoughts.

Anxiety doesn't have to ruin your vacation—or your dog's. By choosing a care environment that mimics the safety of home, you give your anxious pup the best chance at a stress-free stay.
