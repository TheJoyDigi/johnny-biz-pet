- [x] after deploy to prod using script, sitter UI now showing undefined, undefined for location; please check supbase rrr-prod database to see the issue and update the deployment script if needed, if we connect dev server to rrr-dev the locations is showing correctly
- [x] sitter-slug is only use match sitter data for prod deployment, the main app logic should not use sitter-slug but sitter uuid
