        <h2>How We Secure Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. These measures include access controls, encryption in transit and at rest (where applicable), secure data storage, and regular monitoring for potential vulnerabilities. We also limit access to Personal Information to employees, contractors, and service providers who need the information to perform their duties, and who are subject to confidentiality and security obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you access your account information, we use commercially reasonable technological safeguards to secure any information we collect about you. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before sending it to us. In addition, your Owner Account information is password-protected for your privacy and security. You should always take steps to protect the confidentiality of the password you select. You need to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite our efforts, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information, and you acknowledge and accept that you provide such information at your own risk. If we become aware of a data breach involving your personal information, we will take steps to notify you and any applicable regulators as required by law.

        <h2>Collection of Payment Information</h2>
        <p>
          When you make or receive payments through the Services, certain payment-related information will be collected and processed to complete the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are an Owner purchasing a Sitting, you will be asked to provide payment information such as your credit or debit card number, billing address, and other relevant details. This information is collected and processed directly by our third-party Payment Processor (such as Stripe) and is not stored or controlled by Ruh-Roh Retreat. Stripe collects, uses, and processes your payment information in accordance with its own privacy policy, available at <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://stripe.com/privacy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We receive only limited information from Stripe—such as confirmation of payment status, transaction date, and the last four digits of your payment card number—which we use to verify transactions, prevent fraud, and maintain accurate records.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a Sitter receiving payouts through the Services, you may be required to provide certain financial information to our payment processor or payout provider, such as a connected Stripe account, bank account details, or tax identification number. This information is used solely to facilitate payments and comply with applicable tax, accounting, and legal obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sitters are responsible for maintaining accurate and current payment details. Ruh-Roh Retreat is not responsible for delays or failed payouts caused by incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We take reasonable steps to ensure that payment transactions are processed securely. All transactions are encrypted and handled by PCI-compliant payment processors. However, because we do not directly collect or store your full payment information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of payment data transmitted to or from third-party providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          By making or receiving payments through the Services, you acknowledge and agree that your payment information will be handled in accordance with the terms and privacy policies of the applicable payment processor.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Information of Minors</h2>
        <p>
          The Services are intended for individuals 18 years of age or older. If you are under 18, you are not eligible to use the Services or create an Owner Account. We do not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 18. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are an Owner who is under the age of 18, we will have to close your account. If you believe we may have any information about a child under the age of 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@ruhrohretreat.com">hello@ruhrohretreat.com</a>.
